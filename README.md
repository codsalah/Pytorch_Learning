# PyTorch Deep Learning Learning Repository

Welcome to my repository for learning PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework! This repository documents my journey as I explore PyTorch from the basics to more advanced implementations and tutorials.

## Basics

The **Basics** folder contains foundational materials and introductory resources to help you get started with PyTorch. Topics covered include:

- Installation and setup of PyTorch
- Basic tensor operations and manipulations
- Understanding PyTorch's autograd mechanism for automatic differentiation
- Building simple neural networks using PyTorch's nn module

## From Scratch

In the **From Scratch** section, I delve into building neural networks and deep learning models from scratch using PyTorch. This includes:

- Implementing basic neural network architectures such as feedforward networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without using PyTorch's built-in layers and modules
- Understanding the underlying mathematics and principles behind deep learning models
- Implementing backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms from scratch


## Implementations

The **Implementations** folder have more advanced implementations of deep learning models and algorithms using PyTorch. This section includes:

- Implementations of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## PyTorch Tutorials

In the **PyTorch tutorials** section, you'll find tutorials and guides to help you deepen your understanding of PyTorch and its capabilities. This includes:

- Step-by-step tutorials covering various aspects of PyTorch, from basic operations to advanced topics

### Update Note

Please note that this section will be updated over time as I delve deeper into the world of deep learning and implement more algorithms and concepts from scratch using PyTorch.
